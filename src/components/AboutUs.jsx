      <h2>About Paradise Nursery</h2>
      <p>
        Paradise Nursery is a small, plant-obsessed shop that believes every desk, shelf, and living room deserves a
        little greenery.
      </p>
      <p>
        We curate beginner-friendly plants, provide simple care tips, and ship with love (and a tiny bit of dirt… sorry
        in advance).
      </p>
      <p className="small">
        This app is a demo project: browse plants, add to cart, and manage quantities using Redux Toolkit.
