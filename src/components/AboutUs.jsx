      <h2>About Us</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Paradise Nursery</strong> is an online plant shop built for people who want a calmer, greener home —
        even if they’ve never kept a plant alive before.
      </p>

      <p>
        We curate houseplants across multiple categories (indoor favorites, succulents &amp; cacti, and air‑purifying picks),
        and we keep the experience simple: clear product details, transparent pricing, and an easy shopping cart.
      </p>

      <p className="small">
        Our mission: make plant shopping feel friendly, not intimidating — one leaf at a time 🌿
